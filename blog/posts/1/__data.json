But it seems that keeping a record of what you're doing is a good idea. So, recently I installed Ubuntu and am using it as my primary OS. I installed it alongside Windows 8.1. After 4 days with Ubuntu, I have mixed feelings about it, really. The best part about Ubuntu is the font. I know it sounds crazy, but that's the truth. I really like the font. I hope I'll get used to the OS pretty soon. \n\nBut, I miss Windows very much. For far too long, I've been using Windows, and I think saying Goodbye is hard. I think I'll stop talking about Windows here, because if I start, it'll be difficult to give a rest. Let's keep it for the future.  \n  \nHere's a screenshot :P  \n  \n  \n\n[![](https://mrsauravsahu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screenshot2bfrom2b2015-01-262b103a013a07.png?w=300)](https://mrsauravsahu.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screenshot2bfrom2b2015-01-262b103a013a07.png?w=300)\n\n  \n\n  \n\nThe following is basically a log of what I've been doing since the last 4 days. \n\n  \n\n*   01.22.2015\n    \n*   Installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS\n    \n*   Checked Facebook\n    \n\n  \n\n*   01.23.2015\n    \n*   Installed Google Chrome\n    \n*   Installed VLC\n    \n*   Read about Swap Space - [https://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8208-all-about-linux-swap-space](https://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8208-all-about-linux-swap-space)\n    \n*   Read a little bit about Shadow Simulator [https://shadow.github.io/](https://shadow.github.io/)\n    \n*   ENCOUNTERED errors rergarding partitions mounting. Solved by turning off 'Fast Boot' in Windows. Windows saves the state of the files while shutdown into _hiberfil.sys_  so that computer resumes quickly, but others can't access the drives and changes can cause problems.\n    \n\n  \n\n*   01.24.2015\n    \n*   Installed Code Blocks IDE"],"uses":{"params":["blogId"]}}]}
