At least from a customer's perspective. But now I realize the fact that, as a developer, you need to use an OS which is made for developers.  \n\nSo, yes, I've installed Ubuntu, and have been using it for quite a while now. It's pretty good. Here's a little pie chart showing the time taken for the installation. A total of 20-30 minutes for the actual installation, BTW. Creating back up is really important.\n\n  \n\nHere are a few important links:\n\n1. [https://www.ubuntu.com/](https://www.ubuntu.com/)\n\n2. [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation)\n\n  \n\n[![](https://mrsauravsahu.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/992e3-ubuntuinstallation.png)](https://mrsauravsahu.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/992e3-ubuntuinstallation.png)\n\n  \n\nYeah, so, what have I been doing since the last 10 days? \n\nBasically, I've been watching movies and looking for replacement applications to use on Ubuntu.\n\n  \n\nAlso, I'm starting out with a Project on [TOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29). And to make things easy, I'm going to use [Shadow Simulator](https://shadow.github.io/). If you just started using Ubuntu, this link might be important: [https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Ubuntu/article.html](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/Ubuntu/article.html)  \n  \n  \nNOTE: I still use Windows, once in a while ;)"],"uses":{"params":["blogId"]}}]}
