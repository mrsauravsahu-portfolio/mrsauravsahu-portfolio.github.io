But friends really have a special place, don't they? We irritate them, love them, prank them, sometimes don't like them but they're always there for us. I, for one, took quite a bit of time to realise this. People would say this about me all the time, "You don't talk much", and I didn't really know why it was that way. I usually assumed that keeping my problems or thoughts just to myself would help me deal with them a lot better. Apropos to this, me and my college friends finally went on a trip. Well, it was the first trip after we graduated. A very close friend of mine, Nikhil, started planning this trip during the seventh semester, but unfortunately, we couldn't go then. Clearly, the destination was seaside and exotic, Pondicherry. Something came up for almost all of us and we couldn't make it. (Note: mostly it was me ðŸ˜‚ Sorry Nikhil). Feeling the need to make up for this, I started talking about it this September and we gathered our group of friends for the trip. I should apologise to all who couldn't make it, everything happened so fast and couldn't afford to post pone the trip. Apparently, there is something important that is going to happen in Pondicherry and because of that, god (ðŸ˜‚ Aishwarya, couldn't not mention god) didn't want us to visit, at that point of time. Pondicherry had insipid weather for almost a week. The situation there is much worse than I'm describing, and at the time of writing this, people there are still recovering. We showed our spontaneity and changed our destination to Gokarn and enjoyed the beaches, the architecture of the Mirjan fort and the serenity of Jog falls. I'd rather leave the details untold as it is one to be experienced than described. Personally, for me, it was much more than a trip. I never really imagined I'd return with this whole other mindset. We talked about life and it's vagaries, how different and similar we all are. Let's just say that I'm going through a relatively convoluted stage of my life, let's just leave it at that. And definitely, whoever said that, "The journey is more important than the end or the start", how right can you get? So what I'm saying, if I'm saying anything, is keep your friends close. With love, to all my friends, close and far away.</p>   <div class="utterance-root svelte-yttj2i"><script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="mrsauravsahu/portfolio-comments" issue-term="title" theme="github-dark" crossorigin="anonymous" label="comments" async></script></div>  </section> </main>
