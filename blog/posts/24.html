But unlike few, I don't discuss it with others. Living in different parts of the country whilst I was young, means I have memories of places that I don't quite remember vividly, and thus when I see these places in my dreams, it often freaks me out. These places might not mean much to me now, but they must be important when I was a child and that's probably a reason I see the same places again and again popping up. I cannot tell you how deeply our choices are affected by our dreams, at least at a subconscious level. Also, there are people in your life you don't talk to that often, but they turn out to be your best friends in your dream. And then there are those who you talk to everyday, or have a <strong>liking</strong> towards and they turn out to be complete strangers. It's like <em>Mal</em> from <em>Inception</em>, it's not even funny. As a child I was a big fan of Lucid dreaming and it did take me some time getting used to it. Not sure what the right formula is, but I did manage to get some cool superpowers, to say the least. 😆 But too much of anything isn't always good. Change is probably the most difficult thing in the world. I have wondered and wondered about what my dreams meant and made rash decisions based off of them, but this has reduced to a great extent these days.
