I took a couple of classes online, understood the physics and basic concepts, how to use it, all preparing for my first abroad trip to Europe. And then the trip got cancelled. Anyway, after a couple of months, in a free weekend, my family and I, went on a trip to Gokarna, probably last year's April. And I knew this was my chance at showcasing the knowledge I'd gained from all those Mike Browne videos online. And I think I got some pretty good shots. It was a pain waiting to convert all those raw files to JPEGs, but it was worth it. During last year's June, the visit to Europe finally became a reality. The place is divine and it was a great experience, leaving the day to day lives behind for a while. It was another chance for me to get some fabulous shots and enjoy the beauty of it all. Well, I did go back to Gokarna, last November, and what can I say? These memories I will hold on for a lifetime? Probably, yes. It was a wildly different experience, for a couple of reasons, of which I will share a few. Like, this time around however, I visited the place with the best people from my life, apart from my family. All of this made me wonder the power bestowed upon photographers, or someone who clicks pictures, so basically, everyone with a phone or a camera these days. It's a gift how we can capture moments from our lives and have them for safe-keeping. And that's the thing I love about photos. You get to experience others' experiences. Also, photos show details from life and places that is usually missed by our day to day busy schedules. But every coin has a flip side. With our generation, all we like to do is showcase the best of us, the best moments from our lives and it is ludicrous to think about how devastating it feels when you're in a bad mood and you see these beautiful memories from others' lives. And it's not like I haven't done this. Check for all. The main issue with this is the constant "getting-in-the-way-of-our-usual-behavior" thing, we get busy capturing these moments and sometimes forget to live them. I, myself, have done this and would love to change this. So, I guess, what I'm trying to say, if I'm saying anything, is, take a step back; click the picture, put the technology away, and enjoy a little. In case you still want to see what I clicked.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.clickasnap.com/sauravsahu">My ClickASnap Page</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><a href="https://unsplash.com/@_sauravsahu_">My Unsplash Page</a></p></blockquote>   <div class="utterance-root svelte-yttj2i"><script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="mrsauravsahu/portfolio-comments" issue-term="title" theme="github-dark" crossorigin="anonymous" label="comments" async></script></div>  </section> </main>
