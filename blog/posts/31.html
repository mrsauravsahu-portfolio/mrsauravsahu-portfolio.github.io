		 <span class="prefix svelte-1lgcgyg">less than a minute read</span></h4> <hr>       <p>The last one is kind of done. Done, meaning, doesn't matter anymore. JK. 😝 We all live multiple realities. Each and everyone around oneself perceives them differently. And it is quite uncommon that that is who we really are. We express ourselves with our opinions, the way we speak, how we dress, what sort of music we listen to, what our religious views are, etc., the list just goes on. And everyone, be it, our friends, family, or even a stranger looks at us the way we express ourself, without even having the faintest idea of who we truly are. There's a quote which basically says this, which I couldn't find. Music is a unique way of expressing ourselves. We often ask others what sort of music they listen to. But why so? I'm not here to answer such difficult questions 😂 But it would be pretty accurate to say that having similar taste in music does create great bonds amongst friends. Taste in music is weird. I, for one, like some music because of their choice of lyrics, while also appreciate the beat and rhythm in others. Being a primarily hindi and english speaking person, I recently started listening to Kannada music. It was a weird experience when the cab driver put on some Kannada music, and I loved it, without even understanding what was being sung. Obviously, talking about music, I cannot stop myself from mentioning Spotify (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/58zbmlg6wri7r1aepdhpdin9z">mrsauravsahu on Spotify</a>) The idea of sharing your views with others is quite enjoyable, as with everything these days. I'm pretty sure I'd heard of Spotify before, during my college days, but never pushed myself to use it. I joined half a year ago, and am enjoying it since then. Being a developer, I suppose our expectation from a digital experience is much higher than other users. After using so many music apps, only a few stand out, and Spotify, arguably standing in the front. Pictures and media are another way we express ourselves. In terms of applications, clearly, Instagram is a good one. Others might disagree, suggesting it's Snapchat that started it all, the media sharing and stories and all that. Yeah, probably. I prefer Instagram, partly because it's where most of my close friends are, and that for some reason I don't understand how to use Snapchat. Speaking of pictures, I should plug in a few links as well. 😆 Instagram: (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/photosbysaurav">mrsauravsahu on IG</a>) Unsplash: (<a href="https://unsplash.com/@mrsauravsahu">mrsauravsahu on Unsplash</a>) The language we use and how we use it, also expresses us. And it is certain that we create a lot of misunderstandings from this, speaking for myself here. 😅</p>   <div class="utterance-root svelte-yttj2i"><script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js" repo="mrsauravsahu/portfolio-comments" issue-term="title" theme="github-dark" crossorigin="anonymous" label="comments" async></script></div>  </section> </main>
