Monophasic sleep cycle is a routine where you sleep only once a day. And this usually at night, around 6-8 hours. The main reason many do this is because our parents usually follow the same and also because schools start early in the morning and end late afternoon. I'm one of those people who just cannot sleep in the afternoon, unless I have a headache or I'm very tired. So, a biphasic routine was out of the window. But because of my college, I completely busted everything and went completely haywire. Our usual classes were 1100 to 1400. So, I'd sleep by 0000-0100 and wake up by 0900, and I'd still be sleepy in classes, as my classmates would concur (Yes I used that word again. ðŸ˜‚ You know who you are.) Also, I had this weird phase, where I would randomly wake up at 0330 in the morning, and this happened many times during college. That experience was eerie. Now that I'm working, I get to decide my schedule and for the longest time I was starting my day working by 1100, again. Which was fine, but not quite productive. After all this time, I believe I've cracked the best sleep routine, the triphasic sleep cycle. Clearly, this is not something I invented. Just stating what works for me here. ðŸ˜„ Also, this is working in my favor because of the distance between my home and the workplace. First phase: Sleep regularly at around 0000-0030 like a regular routine, but wake up relatively early in the morning. Second phase: This might take some practice. Get ready for work early in the morning and sleep while in transit, the car. Enjoy work and finish tasks on time. Third phase: Leave work at a reasonably early time, usually 1600 or 1700 and again take a nap whilst in transit. One back home, enjoy personal life and pursue hobbies. Maybe hangout with friends and chill. Yep. That's pretty much it. Probably the most difficult part of this is convincing yourself in the morning to get out of bed. But once that is done, everything else will be a piece of cake.
