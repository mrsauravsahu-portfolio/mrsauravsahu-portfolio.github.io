All the tech giants make our lives better, in one way or the other. But each one of us, have a personal favorite. The reason for that might not be the same. Some are like, "everyone uses bla-bla-bla, so I'm also gonna go with that." Others like to stand out from the crowd so, they get something else. Or they just like the functionality it provides. But the point is that no matter what you're using, it shouldn't get in your way, in your daily life. I use my PC, laptop, phone all the time.

It's going in the opposite direction, isn't it? But why am I talking about all this? Because I've seen how technology tears apart friendships. But, there's nothing much we can do about it. What I'm trying to say is that we shouldn't let these things get in our way. We should just use the gadgets available today to make our friends and family closer. That's it. </p><p>BTW, in my last post, I'd said that we're gonna use Stem as a simulator for the TOR project. Actually, Stem is a python library controller for TOR. My bad.
