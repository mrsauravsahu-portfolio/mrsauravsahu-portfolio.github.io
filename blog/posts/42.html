Surprisingly, without making a resolution, I continued doing this and today, we're here at the 300 day mark.\n\nApparently, it takes 21 days to make a habit. Not sure if I'd agree, but I think even if you miss a couple of days, that could be true. But, for me, I didn't want to miss even a single day. So the three hundred day mark today, is a streak.

And I think if you want to keep learning every single day, like a habit, it's still a constant every day effort. Sometimes, you feel really good to learn something new; but there are days where it's just too difficult to continue. Yes there were a lot of days like this and I just finished one lesson on Duolingo.\n\n## So what and how did I learn?\n\nI have also made a YouTube video about this - [300 Days of French](https://youtu.be/b5rNStIF0TQ), but writing things in detail here..\n\n### Duolingo\n\nI started with Duolingo. When you start off any language, only lessons - topics with 5 levels - are available to you. Here I learnt basic nouns, pronouns and verbs.\n\nNow I could say things like\n\n> - j'apprends le fran√ßais..\n\n> - je parle l'anglais\n\nThe lessons started to get a bit more complex and I learnt topics like adverbs, prepositions.\n\n> - je suis √† la maison\n\n### Language Exchange Apps\n\nLanguage exchange apps are really cool. You can talk to and help people who are learning languages. You can also talk to people who know the language you're learning. That'll really help with conversations. Because, really, the spoken languages are really nothing like how they appear in literature.
