Any arbitrary input should never be trusted. And data validation plays a vital role in making sure these inputs are rigorously funnelled through the right pipes before they create unintended side-effects in our applications.</p><h2 id="data-validation-in-the-javascript-world">Data Validation in the JavaScript world</h2><p>In JavaScript projects, both the browser and node.js, that is, there are several npm packages available to do data validation. I've personally used joi and yupjs.</p><p>joi was my goto choice for Data Validation for a long time. It worked really well with hapijs and has a great community around it. Trust me, I don't have anything against joi, it's just that I find yupjs to be more easier for me to work with.</p><p>yupjs is also a data validation library, and gets lots of its characteristics from joi but focuses more on client side validation and can be easily extended.</p><h2 id="an-example-of-a-data-validation">An example of a Data Validation</h2><p>Data validations are done on each property of an incoming "Data Transfer Object". Just a fancy way ðŸŽ“ of saying an object which is created from the raw inputs and passed along for cleaning and processing before actually getting stored or used in other places of an application.</p><p>Let's take a simple signup page example. We will have two inputs and the DTO will have the shape shown below: </p><pre class="tsx"><code>type SignUpDto = {
  userName: string | undefined,
  password: string | undefined
}</code></pre><p>Simple data validations here are:</p><ul><li>the userName and password fields are required </li><li>userName should be of a maximum length of 12 </li><li>password should be a minimum length of 8 </li></ul><p>etc.</p><h2 id="enter-yupjs">Enter yupjs</h2><p>To achieve this, yupjs uses a concept called as a schema for validation. I'm sure you'll find the yupjs library very similar to joi, so let's take a look. The simple validations for the userName and password can be written like shown below:</p><pre class="tsx"><code>import * as yup from 'yup'

type SignUpDto = {
  userName: string | undefined,
  password: string | undefined
}

const signUpSchema = yup.object({
  userName: yup
    .string()
    .required('please enter a username')
    .max(12),
  password: yup
    .string()
    .required('please enter a password')
    .min(8)
})</code></pre><p>As you can see, you can define custom error message for each validation as well. Now this <code>signUpSchema</code> can be used to actually to the data validation, which is shown below:</p><pre class="tsx"><code>const signUp: SignUpDto = {
  userName: 'sample',
  password: undefined
}

signUpSchema.validate(signUp, { abortEarly: false })
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error)
