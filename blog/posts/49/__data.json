But the most difficult part is maintaining this code. \n\nEven though maintenance has many parts to it, in this blog, let’s discuss about versioning. \n\n## An Introduction to Software Versioning\n\n### What is software versioning?\n\nSoftware versioning in a nutshell is just tagging your library with a meaningful version number to make sure that the consumers of your library are aware of the feature set available to them. \n\n### Do I need versioning?\n\nWell, it is not mandated but versioning can have a lot of benefits. While working with simpler projects, versioning might not be an issue but when working in a team, good versioning will align with timelines. Other pros include — \n\n- It gives a clear picture of what changes are happening with new releases.\n- It is easier to backtrack if new changes have severe issues and bugs.\n- Versioning provides a way of documentation.\n\nI’m sure there are many more pros of versioning. Feel free to add them in the comments. \n\n### The simplest versioning scheme\n\nLet’s see if there are issues with versioning now? Well, for starters, doing good versioning is difficult. The simplest versioning scheme would be just incrementing a number — v1, v2 etc. this captures changes fairly well and can be used for small projects. It is a good starting point. \n\nHowever, this scheme doesn’t make it clear, the type of changes going in any new version. So we need a more “semantic” versioning scheme. Enter, the **[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 Spec](https://semver.org/).** Semantic Versioning or “semver” for short, gives a great documented way of documenting. The gist of which is —\n\n\u003Cimg class='half' src='/store/49-software-versioning-an-intro-with-gitversion/images/semver-summary.jpeg' alt='semver summary from semver.org'>\n\n### How can I setup semver for my project?\n\nWell, semver is a specification, so following it manually is a good way to start. You can just make sure that your git tags or release branch names follow the right format and add the change-logs in the commit message. \n\n## GitVersion — A more automated approach to versioning\n\nOne of the best ways to automate versioning is with [GitVersion](https://gitversion.net/). GitVersion is a tool to help with versioning through your git history and commit messages.\n\n> Note: All code related to this blog is available here — [blog-semver@github](https://github.com/mrsauravsahu/blog-semver). Over the next few weeks, I'll be working on improving it so you can always find the latest code here.\n\n### My git workflow setup\n\nFor my projects, I use a simplified version of GitFlow — read more about it [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). But the gist of it is this —\n\n- My main work happens on the `develop` branch. This is where I merge all my changes. If I need to distribute my app, I retain stable releases on the `master` branch.\n- I branch out all my feature branches from `develop`\n- `hotfixes` are created directly from `master` and fixed and merged back. And pulled into `develop` as well.\n\n### Let's setup GitVersion\n\nFor this example, I have a node project. For node projects, the version of the app is present in the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files — in the `\"version\"` property.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"blog-semver\",\n  \"version\": \"0.1.0\",\n  \"description\": \"setting up semver for your projects with Github Actions\",\n\n  ...\n\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's setup GitVersion. You can install GitVersion with one of these methods - [https://gitversion.net/docs/usage/cli/installation](https://gitversion.net/docs/usage/cli/installation). Once you have GitVersion installed, let's create a gitversion.yml config. You can use `$ gitversion init` to create this file. I have a simple config, which looks like —\n\n```yaml\nbranches: {}\nignore:\n  sha: []\nmerge-message-formats: {}\n```\n\nWith the defaults, a PR merge to develop will bump the version with a minor change. So, the first version is `0.1.0`, then `0.2.0` and so on...\n\nNow if you inspect the [CI Github Actions YML File](https://github.com/mrsauravsahu/blog-semver/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yml), you see this stage which calculates the next version with GitVersion. \n\n```yaml\n- name: install gitversion\n\tuses: gittools/actions/gitversion/setup@v0.9.7\n    with:\n    versionSpec: '5.x'\n\n- name: execute gitversion\n  id: gitversion\n  uses: gittools/actions/gitversion/execute@v0.9.7\n  with:\n    useConfigFile: true\n    configFilePath: gitversion.yml\n```\n\n> Note: As I mentioned, GitVersion uses git history to calculate the next version, so you'll have to modify your checkout step as well.\n\n```yaml\n- name: checkout to branch\n  uses: actions/checkout@v2\n  with:\n    fetch-depth: 0 # \u003C--- get the entire history\n```\n\nGitVersion spits out more detailed version values, but I stick to the `MajorMinorPatch` field. Here's what the rest of the fields look like —\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Major\": 1,\n  \"Minor\": 0,\n  \"Patch\": 0,\n  \"PreReleaseTag\": \"alpha.4\",\n  \"PreReleaseTagWithDash\": \"-alpha.4\",\n  \"PreReleaseLabel\": \"alpha\",\n  \"PreReleaseLabelWithDash\": \"-alpha\",\n  \"PreReleaseNumber\": 4,\n  \"WeightedPreReleaseNumber\": 4,\n  \"BuildMetaData\": null,\n  \"BuildMetaDataPadded\": \"\",\n  \"FullBuildMetaData\": \"Branch.develop.Sha.801d0ae8327c24b387690dcd7c0838107e6f5260\",\n  \"MajorMinorPatch\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"SemVer\": \"1.0.0-alpha.4\",\n  \"LegacySemVer\": \"1.0.0-alpha4\",\n  \"LegacySemVerPadded\": \"1.0.0-alpha0004\",\n  \"AssemblySemVer\": \"1.0.0.0\",\n  \"AssemblySemFileVer\": \"1.0.0.0\",\n  \"FullSemVer\": \"1.0.0-alpha.4\",\n  \"InformationalVersion\": \"1.0.0-alpha.4+Branch.develop.Sha.801d0ae8327c24b387690dcd7c0838107e6f5260\",\n  \"BranchName\": \"develop\",\n  \"EscapedBranchName\": \"develop\",\n  \"Sha\": \"801d0ae8327c24b387690dcd7c0838107e6f5260\",\n  \"ShortSha\": \"801d0ae\",\n  \"NuGetVersionV2\": \"1.0.0-alpha0004\",\n  \"NuGetVersion\": \"1.0.0-alpha0004\",\n  \"NuGetPreReleaseTagV2\": \"alpha0004\",\n  \"NuGetPreReleaseTag\": \"alpha0004\",\n  \"VersionSourceSha\": \"5ba4cd98ab31085a2e8057e2d00738bdc0118031\",\n  \"CommitsSinceVersionSource\": 4,\n  \"CommitsSinceVersionSourcePadded\": \"0004\",\n  \"UncommittedChanges\": 0,\n  \"CommitDate\": \"2021-07-24\"\n}\n```\n\nI'm currently working on a new step in Github Actions which writes this new version into the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files and makes a commit, freezing the version into the source code. So, the commit history looks like this —\n\n\u003Cimg src='/store/49-software-versioning-an-intro-with-gitversion/images/gitversion-in-github-actions.png' alt='gitversion in github actions'>\n\nHere's the current Github Actions step which auto commits the version file changes. Note: I'm still actively working on this Github Action, so expect some changes there. 😉 Also, if you notice the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files, the formatting is a little weird. I'm still working on that. 😂\n\n```yaml\n- name: write version to project\n  run: |\n    NEXT_VERSION=${{ steps.gitversion.outputs.MajorMinorPatch }}\n    echo \"NEXT_VERSION=v$NEXT_VERSION\"\n    git checkout ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF#refs/heads/} && git pull origin ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF#refs/heads/} \n    \n    FILE=./package.json\n    MODIFIED_FILE_CONTENTS=`node -e \"const data = require('$FILE'); let modifiedData = { ...data, version: '$NEXT_VERSION' }; console.log(JSON.stringify(modifiedData, undefined, 2))\"`\n    echo $MODIFIED_FILE_CONTENTS > $FILE\n    FILE=./package-lock.json\n    MODIFIED_FILE_CONTENTS=`node -e \"const data = require('$FILE'); let modifiedData = { ...data, version: '$NEXT_VERSION' }; console.log(JSON.stringify(modifiedData, undefined, 2))\"`\n    echo $MODIFIED_FILE_CONTENTS > $FILE\n    \n    git config --global user.name \"Github Actions\" && git config --global user.email \"noreply@github.com\"\n    git add package* \n    {\n      git commit -m \"[skip ci] bump version to $NEXT_VERSION\" &&\n      git push origin ${GITHUB_HEAD_REF#refs/heads/}\n      echo finished writing new version\n    } || {\n      echo no new version detected\n    }\n```\n\n### How do I bump my version?\n\nSo, if you see with each PR, the minor version gets bumped by default. But what if you're not making a minor change? What if it is just a patch? Well, because GitVersion respects commit messages, you can create an empty commit with the message `+semver: patch` to bump the patch version.\n\nHere's the message for other types of version changes —\n\n```yaml\nmajor-version-bump-message: '\\+semver:\\s?(breaking|major)'\nminor-version-bump-message: '\\+semver:\\s?(feature|minor)'\npatch-version-bump-message: '\\+semver:\\s?(fix|patch)'\nno-bump-message: '\\+semver:\\s?(none|skip)'\n```\n\nIf you want to bump from `0.x.x` to `1.0.0`, a `+semver: major` message doesn't work. Found this the hard way, but you need to set the `next-version: 1.0.0` field in the `gitversion.yml` file. This [commit](https://github.com/mrsauravsahu/blog-semver/pull/6/commits/1c4f3b0a67516e360021047f1e1726bf304b0d03) — shows the same. This is only when the next-version is less than `1.0.0`, `+semver: major` should work after that.\n\nSo, that is an introduction to versioning and how to implement it with GitVersion and Github Actions. Happy coding!\n\n— Saurav"],"uses":{"params":["blogId"]}}]}
